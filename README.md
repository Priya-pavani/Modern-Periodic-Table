# Modern-Periodic-Table
This project is done in C-language.
Here I am using structure data model to store the details of an element in the file.

    Members of the structure element are:
        int atomic mass
        char name
        char symbol
        float atomic mass
        char block
The operations on the structure element are:

        Adding an element record
        Deleting an element record
        Updating an element record
        Searching an element by atomic number
        Display all the elements
        Exit from the application


_**This is how the initial screen will look like**_
